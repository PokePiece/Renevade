# Renevade ‚Äì The Hyper Webspace Capital of Webtrix

Renevade is a specialized realm within the **Webtrix**, designed to provide a more immersive, interactive, and customizable web experience. It expands upon the core functions of the Webtrix by introducing modular subsystems, advanced spatial interactions, and highly dynamic content layers. Built on top of the **Windmatrix**, it leverages high-bandwidth logical processing to handle dense, complex web data in real time.

## üåê Overview

The Renevade acts as the **Hyper Webspace capital** of the Webtrix:

- **Realm Structure:** A network of interconnected subsystems, each responsible for managing specific aspects of user experience, content interaction, or AI-driven logic.
    
- **Immersive Webspace:** Extends the 3D spatial interface of the Webtrix, allowing users to move, interact, and manipulate web-based nodes and objects.
    
- **Customization Layer:** Enables developers and users to define custom behaviors, visual effects, and AI interactions within the realm.
    
- **Windmatrix Foundation:** All computationally heavy processes and intelligence operations are handled by the Windmatrix layer, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions.
    

Renevade bridges the **Physical Capital** and **Webspace Capital** of Webtrix, delivering a seamless, interactive interface that blends reality and virtual web intelligence.
